Notes
=====

JPG
----
* iPhone/Canon T2i/
  - DateTimeOriginal stores the event time represented as local time (e.g. 2014:08:08 18:24:24). Timezone data is not stored so can only assume local time.
  - When transferred via USB, mtime is set 
  - A file's mtime includes timezone so when a photo is offloaded from camera (via USB), "DateTimeOriginal" is parsed into that computer's timezone.  This basically means timezone should just be ignored and always assume photo timestamp is local time (of wherever photo was taken)

MOV
----
* iPhone
  - ContentCreateDate stores the event time represented as local time with timezone offset (e.g. 2014:08:08 18:23:53-04:00)
  - When transferred via USB, mtime is set to the exact moment (i.e. correct with respect to timezone). This is in contrast to how JPGs are transferred (which we always assume as local time). Of course, this is only applicable when MOVs are taken in non-Pacific timezones.

* Canon T2i
  - ContentCreateDate is not available
  - CreateDate stores the event time represented as local time (e.g. 2014:08:08 22:23:53)
  - 


AVI
----
* Canon ELPH
  - DateTimeOriginal is the only datetime field available
  - No timezone offset so local time representation
  - mtime is set to DateTimeOriginal upon transfer via USB
