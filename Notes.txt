Notes
=====

JPG
----
- Use SubSecDateTimeOriginal if available, else DateTimeOriginal
- Timezone data is not stored in EXIF so can only assume local time
- A file's last modified time (FileModifyDate/mtime) includes timezone so when a photo is offloaded from camera (via USB), "DateTimeOriginal" is parsed into that computer's timezone.  This basically means timezone should just be ignored and always assume photo timestamp is local time (of wherever photo was taken)


MOV
----
- ContentCreateDate format: 2014:08:08 18:23:53-04:00 (local time with timezone offset)
- CreateDate format: 2014:08:08 22:23:53 (Looks like UTC)
- But when MOVs are transferred via USB, the file mod (mtime) time is correct with respect to timezone, which is inconsistent with JPGs (which we assume as local time).  Of course, this is only applicable when MOVs are taken in non-Pacific timezones
